// Forget about #1 for now and focus on #2. How can we estimate this? Well,
// pick a k and then pick k clauses at random and see if their
// merge/intersection is empty. Repeat this, say, 100 times for each k from
// 1 to 100. That should give us an estimate, for each k, of how many
// "merged clauses" we'll have to deal with at each depth. Fewer is better.

// Run this program on all of SAT-COMP. Look for instances that have few
// merges/intersections, and also that existing SAT solvers do poorly on
// (e.g., run kissat with a short timeout for each). That should give you a
// good idea of which problem instances might be most worthwhile to target.
// The goal would be to find at least one problem in SAT-COMP that
// inclusion/exclusion should be expected to do much better on.

// I expect this to be perhaps a bit easier than actually implementing the
// solver? Again, all you need here is a way to read the DIMACS input
// files, choose k of them at random (in Python, check out the
// random.choices method), and then check if any of them contain
// conflicting literals. Then run that against the SAT-COMP benchmark
// suite.
